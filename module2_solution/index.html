				<p class="content">
					Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

					 Lamb and mutton are terms for the meat of domestic sheep at different ages. A sheep in its first year is called a lamb, and its meat is also called lamb. The meat of a juvenile sheep older than one year is hogget; outside North America this is also a term for the living animal. The meat of an adult sheep is mutton, a term only used for the meat, not the living animal.Meat from sheep features prominently in several cuisines of the Mediterranean. Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in certain parts of China, where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. It is also very popular in Australia. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States and Canada.

						A fish tikka in oven is one of the easiest healthy Indian appetizers that can be made at home. Tikkas are made by using salmon, papplet, pomphret and various other varieties of your own choice. But be sure that a large boneless fish is majorly recommended to make a blisful and tasty fish tikka. The secret of a good recipe lies in the ingredients and the way they are used which takes the best out off a dish.
