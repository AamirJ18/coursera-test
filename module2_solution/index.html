					A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.The nodes of a computer network may be classified by many means as personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or general purpose hosts. They are identified by hostnames and network addresses. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment.

					 An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer.

						A fish tikka in oven is one of the easiest healthy Indian appetizers that can be made at home. Tikkas are made by using salmon, papplet, pomphret and various other varieties of your own choice. But be sure that a large boneless fish is majorly recommended to make a blisful and tasty fish tikka. The secret of a good recipe lies in the ingredients and the way they are used which takes the best out off a dish.
